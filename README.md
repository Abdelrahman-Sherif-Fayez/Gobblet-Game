3. Game Rules

Gobblet is a board game that combines the rules of tic-tac-toe with a memory challenge. 
The game can be played on a 4x4 board, with different levels of difficulty. 
Our goal in Gobblet is to place four of our pieces in a horizontal, vertical, 
or diagonal row. our pieces start nested off the board. On a turn, 
we either play one exposed piece from our three off-the-board piles or move one piece on the board to any other spot on the board where it fits. 
A larger piece can cover any smaller piece. A piece being played from off the board may not cover an opponent's piece unless 
it's in a row where our opponent has three of his color. Our memory is tested as we try to remember which color one of our larger pieces 
is covering before we move it. As soon as a player has four like-colored pieces in a row, he wins â€” except in one case: If you lift your piece and 
reveal an opponent's piece that finishes a four-in-a-row, you don't immediately lose; you can't return the piece to its starting location, 
but if you can place it over one of the opponent's three other pieces in that row, the game continues.
